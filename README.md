🎯 Feature-to-Skill Mapping
1. RTK Query Implementation
Files: src/store/api.js, src/store/store.js
Skills Showcased:

Multiple Endpoint Management: 4 different API endpoints with different data patterns
Caching Strategy: Automatic background refetching and intelligent caching
Conditional Queries: skip parameter for performance optimization
Data Transformation: Real-time search filtering and data manipulation
Error Handling: Comprehensive loading, error, and success state management

javascript// Example: Advanced RTK Query with conditional fetching
const { data: searchResults, isFetching } = useSearchPostsQuery(searchTerm, {
  skip: searchTerm.length < 2, // Performance optimization
  pollingInterval: 30000,      // Real-time updates
})
Enterprise Value: Demonstrates ability to handle complex data fetching scenarios in enterprise analytics applications with optimal performance.

2. Emotion-js Styled Components
Files: src/components/StyledComponents.js
Skills Showcased:

Dynamic Styling: Props-based conditional styling and theming
Advanced CSS Effects: Glass morphism, gradients, backdrop filters
Responsive Design: CSS Grid with media queries
Performance: CSS-in-JS with component scoping
Animation: Hover effects and micro-interactions

javascript// Example: Dynamic styled component with props
export const MetricCard = styled(GlassCard)`
  background: ${props => props.gradient || 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)'};
  color: ${props => props.textColor || '#1f2937'};
  
  &:hover {
    transform: translateY(-2px);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  }
`
Enterprise Value: Shows expertise with modern CSS-in-JS frameworks and design system implementation.

3. Data Visualization Charts
Files: src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx (Chart implementations)
Skills Showcased:

Multiple Chart Types: Pie charts, bar charts, line charts for different data stories
Interactive Features: Tooltips, legends, responsive design
Data Processing: Real-time data transformation for visualization
Performance: Memoized chart data to prevent unnecessary re-renders

javascript// Example: Advanced data processing for charts
const chartData = useMemo(() => {
  const postsPerUser = users.map(user => ({
    name: user.name.split(' ')[0],
    posts: posts.filter(p => p.userId === user.id).length,
    comments: comments.filter(c => 
      posts.some(p => p.id === c.postId && p.userId === user.id)
    ).length
  })).slice(0, 8)
  
  return { postsPerUser, userActivity, engagementTrend }
}, [users, posts, comments])
Enterprise Value: Perfect demonstration of transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights for business intelligence.

4. Real-time Search & Filtering
Files: src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx (Search functionality)
Skills Showcased:

Debounced Search: Performance optimization for real-time search
Conditional API Calls: Smart API usage with skip conditions
UI State Management: Loading indicators and result displays
User Experience: Instant feedback and smooth interactions

javascript// Example: Real-time search with performance optimization
const { data: searchResults, isFetching } = useSearchPostsQuery(searchTerm, {
  skip: searchTerm.length < 2 // Only search with 2+ characters
})
Enterprise Value: Demonstrates ability to create intuitive data exploration tools for business users.

5. Responsive Grid Layout
Files: src/components/StyledComponents.js (Grid components)
Skills Showcased:

CSS Grid Mastery: Complex multi-dimensional layouts
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
Single-Screen Design: No scrolling, optimal space utilization
Performance: Efficient rendering with proper grid sizing

javascript// Example: Advanced CSS Grid with responsive design
export const DashboardGrid = styled.div`
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
  height: calc(100vh - 2rem);
  
  @media (max-width: 1024px) {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
`
Enterprise Value: Shows ability to structure complex applications with maintainable, scalable layouts.

6. State Management & Performance
Files: Throughout components
Skills Showcased:

React Hooks: useState, useMemo, useEffect for optimal performance
Memoization: Preventing unnecessary re-renders
Error Boundaries: Graceful error handling
Loading States: Comprehensive UI feedback

javascript// Example: Performance optimization with useMemo
const metrics = useMemo(() => ({
  totalUsers: users?.length || 0,
  avgEngagement: posts && comments ? (comments.length / posts.length).toFixed(1) : 0
}), [users, posts, comments])
Enterprise Value: Demonstrates understanding of performance optimization in data-heavy enterprise applications.
